         The KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle is a design principle in software development 
         that emphasizes the importance of simplicity. It suggests that systems should be kept as 
         simple as possible, avoiding unnecessary complexity. The KISS principle is based on the idea 
         that simplicity leads to better usability, reliability, and maintainability.


         ** In simple terms ** 

         In simple terms, the KISS principle means that things work best when they are kept simple rather 
         than made complicated. It suggests that you should strive for simplicity in design and avoid 
         unnecessary complexity. This principle is often used in software development to encourage developers 
         to write code that is easy to understand, maintain, and use.
